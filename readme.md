# **IN PRE-PRODUCTION**

## This will be my first project in the path to Data Analytics. That will probably use PowerBI, SQL, React, and Django to deploy insights on some yet obscure healthcare data I have to still do research about 

Initial notions about hte project
1. will probably utilize some sort of google forms survey instead of scraping since web scraping is only for web data not publicly available and used if tabular data that exists online is not sufficient 
2. survey will ask about how chronic illnesses, varicocele, skin disease can affect mental and physical well-being
3. my questions are what can be teh possible variables/features of this data that will be molded into a large data set
4. will probably use react or django to render the dashboard I will be building in PowerBI

## Problems to solve:
1. I can't save year as 4 byte int for 200000+ rows since that would be a waste of space
